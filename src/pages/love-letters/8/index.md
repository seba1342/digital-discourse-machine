I run my greedy... fever-quiv’ring hand ✋
‘Round goddess-contour o’your damascus Flesh..
Aye soothing touch exacting ‘toxicant moldey
From your soul’s clavichord, taut, laughing fresh

And caress your tempting lips 💋 aye avidly,
With my starched soul upon scaleded mine,
Sun-baked ☀️, desert-thirst, to appease a-seeking
By vivifying thrall of your kisses wine 🍷

Oh most wanton 🥟 delight, your skin’s qintessence!
Honeysuckle 🍯, amber, nectar from the bloom exotic.
And dip.. sindazed, I.. my embattled soul
Tixt warm concavity o’your breasts’ erotic..

Or whisper 🤫, faint sweet words o’nothingness
In alabaster shell ‘neath, damp, luxurious hair 💁
Your dim, tender voice distilling Lust into the brain 🧠
My thoughts 💭 of you - in you to loose fore’er and e’er

My Nirwana, do not flail, do not scold.. but beware!..
This passion, insatiation grim 💀, to me, YOU.. will’d!..
O’your lips having tast’d and flesh and words insane 🤪
