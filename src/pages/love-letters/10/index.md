How happy was I dear Olive 🕊 when I lived at home secure of your love 🥰

and never did suspect that anything could have made you forget me 🤷 

but now I see your memory failed and my misfortune increased and I fear that absence hath made you neglect writing ✏️ unto me, 

and changed that constant love 💖 which in my opinion was wholly mine, 

but it may be I lived deceived then, 

and God ⛪️ hath been pleased with this occasion to open mine eyes 👀 that I might see how little you esteem me, 

here have come two posts and I have received no letters 💌 from you, 

it may be mine have been so long that because I should not trouble you with so much letter you thought god to forbear writing, 

thinking I could not be so shameless as to do it without correspondence. 

Alas sweet Olive 🍸 if my love were like yours I could forbear to show it, 

but it is impossible for if you did but know how miserably I pass this life, 

from the sight of your eyes you could not chose but pity me. 

I left my heart with your sweet breast 🍉 at my departing from you, 

and am united there with you in despite of this tedious intermission of my joy 😂

which makes me live here like a man without a soul 👻

therefore you ought to love 💖 that love 💖 which is in me though you have none yourself let me entreat you to have a care to let me know how you and your children too though you write not to me, 

for that is sum comfort and makes me enjoy myself a little, 

I wonder my mother 👩‍👧 would forget me, but sure she know not of the posts 📮 coming, 

I send you by Dick 🍆 Grimes a chain of gold 🏆
