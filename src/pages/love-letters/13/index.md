This moment I have set myself to copy some verses out fair 📝 

I cannot proceed with any degree of content. I must write you a line or two and see if that will assist in dismissing you from my Mind for ever so short a time ⏳

Upon my Soul I can think of nothing else – The time is passed when I had power to advise and warn you against the unpromising morning 🌄 of my Life – My love has made me selfish. 

I cannot live ⚰️ without you – I am forgetful of every thing but seeing 👀 you again – my Life seems to stop ✋ there – I see no further. 

You have absorb’d me. I have a sensation at the present moment as though I was dissolving – I should be exquisitely miserable without the hope of soon seeing you. 

I should be afraid 😱 to separate myself far from you. 

My sweet Fanny, will your heart ❤️ never change? My love ❤️, will it? I have no limit now to my love ❤️

You note came in just here – I cannot be happier away from you – ‘T is richer than an Argosy of Pearles. 

Do not threat me even in jest 🃏. I have been astonished that Men could die Martyrs for religion 💒 

I have shudder’d at it – I shudder no more – I could be martyr’d for my Religion – Love ❤️ is my religion 💒 – I could die ☠️ for that – I could die for you 👉🙍‍

My Creed is Love and you are its only tenet 🏡 – You have ravish’d me away by a Power ⚡️ 

I cannot resist: and yet I could resist till I saw 👀 you; and even since I have seen you I have endeavoured often “to reason against the reasons of my Love.” I can do that no more – the pain 🤕 would be too great.

My Love is selfish 🦀 

I cannot breathe without you 🌬
