Once upon a time there lived an artist; a man who painted beautiful pictures of landscape 🎨🎨

He was very handsome, with black and straight 🌟 shiny hair 🌟

His nose was terribly large and elegant, like this 👃

One day he happened to meet a lovely young princess and fell in love with her and they live happily ever after together in his studio 👸❤️🤴
