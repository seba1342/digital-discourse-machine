There is a definite possibility that I will be killed in my attempt to get Reagan. It is for this very reason that I am writing you this letter now. 📝

As you well know by now I love you very much 💗💗💗

Over the past seven months I've left you dozens of poems 🗒, letters 📩and love messages 👉👌 in the faint hope that you could develop an interest in me. 

Although we talked on the phone a couple of times I never had the nerve to simply approach you and introduce myself 😬

Besides my shyness, I honestly did not wish to bother you with my constant presence. 

I know the many messages left at your door 🚪 and in your mailbox 📬 were a nuisance, but I felt that it was the most painless way for me to express my love for you 💗💗💗 

I feel very good about the fact that you at least know my name and know how I feel about you 🤪🤪🤪

And by hanging around your dormitory, I've come to realize that I'm the topic of more than a little conversation, however full of ridicule it may be. 

At least you know that I'll always love you 💗💗 

Jodie, I would abandon this idea of getting Reagan 🔪 in a second if I could only win your heart 🥇💗 and live out the rest of my life with you, whether it be in total obscurity or whatever. 

I will admit to you that the reason I'm going ahead with this attempt 🔪🔪🔪 now is because I just cannot wait any longer to impress you. 

I've got to do something now to make you understand 🧠, in no uncertain terms, that I am doing all of this for your sake 👉! By sacrificing my freedom and possibly my life, I hope to change your mind about me. 

This letter is being written only an hour ⏰ before I leave for the Hilton Hotel. 

Jodie, I'm asking you to please look into your heart and at least give me the chance, with this historical deed ☠️⚰️, to gain your respect and love.
