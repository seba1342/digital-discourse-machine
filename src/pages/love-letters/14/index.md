Frances! I am so lonely I can hardly bear it 🐻 

As one needs happiness 😌 so have I needed love ❤️ that is the deepest need of the human spirit 👻 

And as I love you utterly, so have you now become the whole world of my spirit 🌍

It is beside and beyond anything that you can ever do for me; it lies in what you are, dear love — to me so infinitely lovely that to be near you, to see you 👀, hear you 👂, is now the only happiness, the only life, I know 🧠 

How long these hours ⏳ are alone!

Yet is good for me to know the measure 📏 of my love and need, that I may at least be brought to so govern myself as never to lose the love 🥰 and trust 🤞 that you have given me. 

Dear Frances 🇫🇷, let us make and keep our love more beautiful 💄 than any love has ever been before. 

Forever, dearest one 🌹
