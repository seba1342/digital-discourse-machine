My angel 👼, my all, my own self — only a few words today, and that too with pencil ✏️ (with yours) — only till tomorrow is my lodging definitely fixed. 

What abominable waste of time ⏱ in such things — why this deep grief 😕, where necessity speaks?

Can our love persist 💗💪 otherwise than through sacrifices, than by not demanding everything? 

Canst thou change it, that thou are not entirely mine, I not entirely thine?

Oh, God 👼, look into beautiful Nature 🌲 and compose your mind 🧠 to the inevitable. 

Love 🌹 demands everything and is quite right, so it is for me with you, for you with me.

Only you forget so easily, that I must live for you and for me. 

Were we quite united 🤞, you would notice this painful 🤒 feeling as little as I should.

We shall probably soon meet, even today I cannot communicate my remarks to you, which during these days I made about my life. 

Were our hearts close 💕 together, I should probably not make any such remarks. 

My bosom is full, to tell you much 🗣— there are moments when I find that speech is nothing at all. 

Brighten up 💡 — remain my true and only treasure, my all, as I to you.

The rest the gods must send, what must be for us and shall.
