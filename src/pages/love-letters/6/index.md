"Oh my beloved” Do you not hear my ❤️ calling you? 

I lay awake long hours thinking last night 🌃, and then I dreamed again, a strange dream.

It is long since I have had sleeping dreams, the waking ones I am never without.

I feel as if it would all suddenly melt away, this great happiness. 

But it must not dear heart, it would be to cruel and I do not want to suffer so.
Come and let me look at you and know that it is real 👀👀

My sweet play mate and not some magic person who might dissappear at any moment.
