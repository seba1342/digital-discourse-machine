I’m sorry I haven’t returned your call 📞

I have often thought of it but if the truth be known, it would be an easier matter for me to jump on a plane ✈️ and come to see you in person than to make a phone call.

How are you though. My phone machine now picks up on the fifth ring and when I’m home I always pick up before that - by the third ring. 

Do you have a busy schedule this fall? 🍂 I got nothing planned! I’m thinking about that novel though…. and short essays. 

And I’ve just composed a lay-out for another children’s picture story book a remake of the 3 pigs 🐖🐖🐖 

My brother who is still waiting for his permanent work visa to Australia 🦘 (he’s been at it since the last week of May! 😑😑 Length of wait typical for the consulates backlog). 

He has set up this computer at my place which is an incredible device. These household pets here pictured come from computer land. My correspondent D. Pinkwater composes all his picturebooks on computer… 

The method is fun because it forces a kind of spastic retardation struggle needed to make images 🤪🤪

Hope all well with you.

Luv, Kathleen 💕💕
