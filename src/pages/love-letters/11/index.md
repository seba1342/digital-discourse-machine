Happy Birthday Princess 👸🎉👸

We get old and get used to each other 👵👴

We think alike 💭

We read each others minds 🤯

We know what the other wants without asking 🗣

Sometimes we irritate each other a little bit 😡

Maybe sometimes take each other for granted 😑

But once in awhile, like today, I meditate on it and realize how lucky I am to share my life with the greatest woman I ever met 😵

You still fascinate and inspire me 😍

You influence me for the better 💪

You’re the object of my desire, the #1 Earthly reason for my existence 🌍

I love you very much 💏
